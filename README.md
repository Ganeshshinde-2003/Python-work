<h1>Python Programs Repository</h1>
<p>This repository contains a collection of Python programs I've written over the last 6 months. These programs cover a wide range of topics, including web scraping, data analysis, and machine learning.

Each program is stored in its own folder, and includes a README file explaining the purpose of the program and how to use it.

Feel free to use these programs as a learning resource or inspiration for your own projects. Contributions are also welcome! </p>
